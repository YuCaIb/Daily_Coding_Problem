import node as n
import random

tree = n.Node()

# I'm kinda lazy today. I will be doing this tomorrow. 16.04.2025 02:24
# I already figured how to generate random nodes and test them.
# 1. generete random trees and use random.randint(0,1) like n.Node(val= random.rand......)
# I still have to figure how to check each node unival or not.... so that was the problem you know..
